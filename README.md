# Traffic Light Udacity Project
 The system is a traffic light control system using an AVR  Atmega32 MCU and 1 push button to PD2 (INT0) to control the  traffic lights for cars and pedestrians. 

the traffic light control system using an AVR
Atmega32 MCU and a push button to switch between normal and
pedestrian modes can effectively control the traffic lights for cars
and pedestrians. The system's behavior changes depending on the
button press, and the state machine clearly depicts the system's
behavior in both normal and pedestrian modes. The user stories
provide a clear understanding of the expected behavior from the
pedestrian's perspective.
